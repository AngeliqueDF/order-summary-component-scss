## Description

This project is my solution to the Order Summary Component challenge from Frontend Mentor.

The most challenging part was deciding on the HTML structure with the information given.

I still find that I relied to much on `<div>` elements.
Any suggestion on the markup is welcome!

## Features

- Responsive.
- Semantic and accessible HTML5.

<br />

## Technologies

- Semantic `HTML5`.
- `SCSS`.
- `Flexbox`.
- Bundled with `parcel` (v2).

<br />

## How I built this project

1.  Started by structuring the page with semantic and accessible HTML.
2.  Styled the page with a mobile-first approach.

### What I learned

I added `parcel` to have an idea of how to use it compared to `webpack` and `gulp`. I didn't have to write any JavaScript or add any loader, even for SCSS support! The plugin needed was installed automatically.

All it required to work was (updated):

1. Installing `parcel`.
2. Start working using `npm run build`:

```json
"source": "/src/index.html",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "parcel",
    "build": "parcel build"
  },
```

With this configuration:
- `"source": "/src/index.html"` indicates the path to the entry of the app.
- `npm start` starts a local server, enables live reload for development.
- `npm run build` generate a `/dist` folder to use for deployment.

This was ideal for such a small project.

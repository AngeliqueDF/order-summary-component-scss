## Features

- Responsive.
- Semantic and accessible HTML5.
- CSS written with SCSS.

<br />

## Technologies

- Semantic ``HTML5``.
- ``SCSS``.
- ``Flexbox``.
- Bundled with ``Parcel.js``.

## How I built this project

 1. Started by structuring the page with semantic and accessible HTML.
 2. Styled the page with a mobile-first approach.

### What I learned

I added ``Parcel`` to have an idea of how to use it compared to ``Webpack`` and ``Gulp``. I didn't have to write any JavaScript or add any loader, even for SCSS support! This was ideal for such a small project.

The most challenging part was choosing the right HTML elements. And I still find that I relied to much on ``<div>`` elements.

Any suggestion on the markup is welcome!
